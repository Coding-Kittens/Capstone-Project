The title of my site is Writing Aura.

* I used Flask and React.

**Testing:**

* Tests for my front end are in a tests folder in the src folder of the React app.
	* Run the back end with a test db, in main.py
	
			`os.environ["DATABASE_URL"] = "postgresql:///library_test"`
		* run the back end `flask run`
	* Run the tests for the front end

		`npx jest -i`

* Tests for my Back end are in file called test_app.py outside of the src folder.
	* Run the tests for the back end
	`python test_app.py  unittest `
	
**My API:**

* My API keeps track of all the information used in my front end and handles authentication and authorization.
* It keeps track of what user is logged in with flask-session.
* I made all the routes for each table.
* For the routes where you add, edit, or delete information, it checks to make sure the user is authorized.
* For routes where you get information that is privet, it checks to make sure the user is authorized.
* It keeps track of information for:
	* Users
	* Books
	* Libraries
	* Characters
	* Places
	* Notes
	* Bookmarks
