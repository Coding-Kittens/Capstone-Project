# **Project Proposal**

* What tech stack will you use for your final project?
	 * Iâ€™ll be using React for the front-end and Python/Flask for the back-end

* Is the front-end UI or the back-end going to be the focus of your project? Or are you going to make an evenly focused full-stack application?
	* My project will be a full-stack application.

* Will this be a website? A mobile app? Something else?
 * It will be a web app.

* What goal will your project be designed to achieve?

	* The goal is to let the user write books in book form, like kindle but for writing books, and to let the user choose what atmosphere/environment to write in.

* What kind of users will visit your app? In other words, what is the demographic of your users?

	*  Mostly fantasy writers but other writers too
	*  World builders
	*  Anyone that wants to write a book either for themselves, just share with a few people, or to share with everyone.
	*    People that want to read books.

* What data do you plan on using? How are you planning on collecting your data?
	*  I will get my data from my API

-
 In brief, outline your approach to creating your project, Answer questions like the ones below.

* What does your database schema look like?
	* I made a pdf file for my database schema "database_schema.pdf"
	* I added some of the tables that would be used for some of the stretch goals.

* What kinds of issues might you run into with your API?
	* Testing
	* Handling images
	* Figuring out how to store the stories if I let the users change the font size. The font size could change the amount of words that show up on a page, so if I stored each page then I would have update every page each time they change the size. But if I put all the text in the book and just show the text that would fit on the page, then it could be hard to keep track of bookmarks and images that are on specific pages.

* Is there any sensitive information you need to secure?
	* I need to secure passwords.

* What functionality will your app include?
	* Writing books.
	* Reading other peoples books.
	* Organizing your books.
	* Writing notes about your stories.
	* Keep track of characters and places in your stories.
	* Create bookmarks.
	* Change the theme of the book/site.

* What will the user flow look like?
	* Login/sign up.
	* Create a book or edit an old one.
	* Read your books or other peoples.
	* When you're finished with a part of the book, or all of it, share it with others if you want to.


* What are your stretch goals?
 	* If I can get it working, uploading images for the cover and pictures in the books.
 	* Maybe being able to comment on a book or message other users and follow other users.
 	* letting only certain people read your books.
 	* Maybe you can change things about the text, like font size.

 -
* Extra stretch goals/ideas
 	* A part of the app where people can share story ideas with each other
 	* Other little tools to help organize or make stories, like a Plot Diagram
 	* A user could have multiple libraries to organizer their books or to create groups of pubic books that they would like to read.
 	* Maybe letting the user create a custom theme, they could change the background color of things on the page.
